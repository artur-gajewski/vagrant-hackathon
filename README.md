Vagrant Hackathon
=================

###Prerequisites

In order to get up-to-speed at the hackathon, I strongly suggest you go ahead and install all required software dependancies ahead of time.

You will need the following:

* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
* [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

To check if you already have Ruby installed, you can enter this at the command line:

        $ ruby -v
